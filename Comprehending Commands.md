# Cat not the pet but the command 
The challenge demanded to read the file named `flag` using the `cat` command.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0qFpKvnrkqWnsO7XEiMkIGUst0j.QX4cTO0wSO5kjNzEzW}`
After logging in, I used `cat flag` to display the file contents.
TERMINAL WORKING : 
```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{0T3mKpmd6T2EEh-wKsle-wxsYkw.QXxcTN0wSO5kjNzEzW}
```
This generated the flag and the challenge was completed!


## What I learned
I learned the following from this challenge : 
1. `cat` prints file contents to the terminal. 
2. You can concatenate multiple files by passing several filenames to `cat`.

# Catting absolute paths
The challenge demanded to read a flag file by giving its absolute path to `cat`.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{g4Oco2wJyj_YCFfP4wPC7sYB-5G.QX5ETO0wSO5kjNzEzW}`
I provided the absolute path `/flag` to `cat` to read the file.  
TERMINAL WORKING : 
```
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{g4Oco2wJyj_YCFfP4wPC7sYB-5G.QX5ETO0wSO5kjNzEzW}

```
This generated the flag and the challenge was completed!


## What I learned
I learned the following from this challenge : 
1. Absolute paths (starting with `/`) point to exact locations in the filesystem.
2. `cat /path/to/file` works regardless of the current directory.
3.
