# The Ripper — Recovering the Hidden Passcode

---

## Challenge summary

The guardian of this floor, known only as **Jack the Ripper**, presents a word list and a file that contains a hashed secret. 
The objective is to combine the two correctly — using the word list as candidate passphrases — to discover the passcode hidden inside the hash file.

## Files provided

**`hash.txt`** — contains the hashed passcode (bcrypt-format hash).
**`wordlist.txt`** — candidate passphrases.

## How I solved it

**Environment selection and setup.**
</br>
I chose **Google Colaboratory (Colab)** as the execution environment. I learnt about Colab as a environment where one can download softwares over a cloud and execute python3 codes without having to burden their OS. 
</br>

**Dependencies installation.**
</br>
I installed the Python `bcrypt` package inside the Colab notebook to enable native bcrypt verification.
</br>
**Approach and workflow.**
</br>
I then did the following using a python code generated by chatGPT : 
   * Read the bcrypt hash from `hash.txt`.
   * Iterate through each candidate in `wordlist.txt`.
   * Stop when a candidate produces a positive match and format the discovered passphrase as `citadel{<passphrase>}`.
</br>

 Executing this generated the flag.

## What I learnt
</br>
**Bcrypt**
</br>
**Bcrypt** is a password hashing function designed to be slow and adaptive to resist brute-force and dictionary attacks.Specifically designed for hashing passwords.
</br>
**Hash format**: A typical bcrypt hash looks like `$2b$12$<22-char-salt><31-char-hash>` where:
  * `$2b$` indicates the bcrypt version.
  * `12` is the cost factor.
  * The remainder encodes the salt and the derived key.
