# The sound of music

## Challenge summary
The flag was hidden in these digital footprints across music platforms and split into three segments. 
We were required to find all three to uncover the complete code and move on to the next floor.

## How I solved it
I looked up the most sought after sites for music review writing.
I do not quite remember the first site, but the second part of the flag was found on the website [https://rateyourmusic.com/] under the username ` citadweller `.
The third part was found on the Spotify playlist whose link was provided in the RYM website.
